# Influencer Performance Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project features a comprehensive, multi-page Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and visualize the performance of a set of social media influencers. The analysis provides deep insights into engagement, audience demographics, content performance, and monetization potential.

## Project Summary (From GitHub About Section)
Developed a 6-page Power BI dashboard using an influencer dataset. Analyzed engagement rates, follower growth, content reach, and top-performing categories. Implemented advanced visuals like heatmaps, donut charts, and trend lines for better insights.

## Dashboard Pages & Key Insights

The dashboard is organized into multiple tabs for focused analysis:

1.  **Summary:** Provides an "at-a-glance" view, showing a strong average reach of **60.12%** and identifying top-performing influencers like James Anderson and Olivia Taylor by engagement rate.
2.  **Engagement Trend:** Compares post reach by country, noting the highest reach comes from the USA, Brazil, and Germany.
3.  **Content Performance:** Identifies top content categories for total posts, including Music, Food, and Comedy.
4.  **Audience Demographics:** Analyzes follower count by country (Brazil and France show high follower counts) and the high average reach generated by **Verified Accounts**.
5.  **Hashtag & Collaboration:** Visualizes brand collaborations and shows that the majority of influencers fall into the **Medium Ratio** engagement level (46.85%).
6.  **Influencer Value & AI Insights:** Breaks down the total Engagement Score, highlighting the overwhelming value contribution of the **Mega Influencer Tier**.

## Next Steps for the Project

To complete this portfolio project, I plan to:
* **Upload the Power BI (.pbix) Source File** to allow users to interact with the original dashboard.
* **Upload the Cleaned Dataset** (The Excel/CSV file with the anonymized data) used to create the dashboard.
